# Base Library Design

This library was created for the purpose of studying numerical methods in a university class.

The base design loosely follows this:

- Using SymPy for symbolic expression capabilities;
- Using NumPy for certain linear equation solutions;
- Each methodology class captures the current data and provides methods to get required solutions;

## Unit Tests

Each methodology class has to be tested using unit tests. 

Currently, default Python unit test library is used.
